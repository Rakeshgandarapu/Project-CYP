 # 🌾 Crop Yield Prediction using Neural Networks

## 📌 Overview
This project predicts **crop yield** using **machine learning and deep learning models**.  
It combines a **web-based frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)** for user interaction with a **Python backend** that handles data preprocessing and model training using **Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs)**, **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**, and **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks.

## ⚙️ Features
- Interactive **web interface** for entering crop, soil, and weather data.  
- Backend with **FNN, RNN, and LSTM models** for yield prediction.  
- Data preprocessing pipeline for handling soil, climate, and crop features.  
- Model evaluation using **MAE, RMSE, and R² Score**.  
- Modular design – frontend and backend are decoupled for scalability.
